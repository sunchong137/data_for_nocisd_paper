Data for the figures in the SNOCISD paper
=========================================
# Notes:

1. `ndets2` means 2 determinants on top of the HF determinant, so `3` determinants in total.
2. The delta t value in our simulation is twice the value presented in the paper. In our code, we used the finite difference $\delta t$/2, 
but in the paper, using $\delta t$ makes the equations look more compact.
